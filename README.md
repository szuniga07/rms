# rms
This has a shiny app that implements the rms package. 

The packages needed to run this app are listed at the top of the server.r file.

I will update this whenever I can, I have a list of changes that I want to make to allow you to work more efficiently. 

For example, I would like to have more drop boxes for the function arguments.

If you have suggestions, let me know.
